# colour pick game

#### To setup the webpack dev server

npm ci

# 2. run dev server on localhost:9000
npm run dev
```

Open browser to `http://localhost:9000/` to view the app.

### Notes:

- Unfortunately I could not get the game logic to work on time. The game has many bug issues.
- I believe `setInterval()` was not the appropriate function to use, & there must be a better alternatives.
- first attempt using Pixi.js in a short time and enjoyed the library, would love to have another go at some point.
